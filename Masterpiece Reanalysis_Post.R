#Our analysis led to different results than those reached by Professor Barak-Correnâ€™s conclusions based on non-responses.  
#For opposite-sex couples, the explicit rejection rate before Masterpiece was 5.6% while after Masterpiece that rate was 8.7%.   
#This difference is statistically significant at p=.011.  

t.test(Binary.Response_Rej~Post_Court, data=OS) # Explicit rejections incresed from 5.6% to 8.7%, significant at .011
t.test(Binary.Response_Rej~Post_Court, data=SS) #Not significant (.06)

#Replicating in-text numbers, compare to table OA4.4.  
t.test(Binary.Response~Post_Court, data=OS)

#While Professor Barak-Corren points out that there is a significant decline in willingness to serve same-sex couples between 
#Wave 1 and Waves 3 and 4, when we perform the same analysis on opposite-sex couples we find that their decline  just missed significance
#by a hair at p=.053 (or a 5.3% chance that the decline was due to statistical chance; again anything under .05 being significant) 

#Almost sig (.053) for their binary for mixed-sex after, clearly sig for same-sex
t.test(Binary.Response~Post_Court, data=OS) #Matches table OA4.4. 
t.test(Binary.Response~Post_Court, data=SS) #Matches table OA4.4. 

#We examined only those businesses that explicitly declined to serve a same-sex couple before Masterpiece and looked at how many in this group also 
#explicitly declined to serve an opposite-sex couple. 

#Subset businesses that explicitly declined to serve same-sex before masterpiece.

#Subset to only have post-Masterpiece cases
